/*
Solve the following problem using a program: Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings
account with an annual interest rate of 5%. Thus, the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417.
After the first month, the value in the account becomes 100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
After the second month, the value in the account becomes (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) =
201.252
And after the third month, the value in the account becomes (100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) =
302.507
â€¦ and so on.
Write a program that randomly generates monthly savings amounts for the 15 runners in Problem 4.
Each monthly saving should be in the range of $100 to $800. Extend the AddressBook class to
store the monthly savings generated by the random number generator.
Then, display the final account value for each of the 15 runners.
