Google Inc. is looking to recruit three of the Boston runners. The criteria for selection are as follows:
I. Average final marks in bachelor’s degree (store up to 2 decimal places). The fifteen candidates
have the following grades: 82.30%, 85.10%, 77.77%, 69.93%, 93.03%, 88.61%, 55.99%, 87.49%,
88.00%, 91.20%, 66.79%, 76.65%, 55.89%, 90.01%, and 87.9%.
II. Ability to communicate as one of the three values – “excellent”, “average”, and “poor”. The
fifteen candidates have the following ability to communicate, respectively: poor, poor, average,
average, average, poor, excellent, excellent, excellent, average, excellent, average, excellent,
excellent, poor.
III. Innovation as one of the two values – “brilliant” and “average” (store as a Boolean; brilliant =
true and average = false). The fifteen candidates have the following innovative abilities:
brilliant, average, average, average, brilliant, brilliant, average, brilliant, average, brilliant,
average, brilliant, brilliant, average, average.
IV. Ability to regulate one’s own skill as a probability value between 0 and 1.0 – 1.0 implies
excellent regulatory capabilities and 0.0 implies no skills to regulate (store as a double). The
fifteen candidates have the following regulatory abilities: 0.5, 1.0, 0.8, 0.0, 1.0, 0.7, 0.8, 0,9, 0.5,
0.6, 0.3, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3, 0.8.
Store these values for the fifteen candidates in an extended AddressBook class. In general, Google
will not consider a candidate with average marks of less than 85%. Google will consider a candidate
with average marks of less than 85% only if the candidate at least has 0.5 regulatory abilities and at
least ‘average’ ability to communicate. Google will only consider a candidate with poor
communication ability if the candidate has a ‘brilliant’ innovation capability. Write a program that
will help Google to programmatically determine eligibility of the fifteen candidates for these
positions, and print the output on the console.
